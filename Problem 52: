Problem Scenario 52 : You have been given below code snippet.
val b = sc.parallelize(List(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,2,4,2,1,1,1,1,1))
Operation_xyz
Write a correct code snippet for Operation_xyz which will produce below output. scalaxollection.Map[lnt,Long] = Map(5 -> 1, 8 -> 1, 3 -> 1, 6 -> 1, 1 -> S, 2 -> 3, 4 -> 2, 7 -> 1)


b = sc.parallelize([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,2,4,2,1,1,1,1,1])

counts=b.countByValue()
